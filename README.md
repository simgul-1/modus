## How do I run this?

```sh   
Do this.
```
Now is the time for create new MySQL database and then import the table from file: traffic-alerts.sql
```sh
Do that.
```
Edit the server configuration file and set MySQL credentials and Facebook APP credentials
```sh
And this.
```
Edit the Facebook loader for client side and set Facebook APP id
```sh
And that.
```
Then write:
```sh

```
If everything worked you'll have something like us.
